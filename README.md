# Python-Programs (Rewritten by Ian Botashev)

I'm not fully sure why I chose to rewrite all of this. I understand that this is actually just personal programs, but i thought it would be an interesting challenge. 
This is also the reason why i won't be making a pull request. But, if you do want me to make a pull request, I will. But, it will needed to be noted to revert this README.md to the original from master, or merge them together.

## Rewritten files so far:
- Calculator.py
- Mean Calculator.py
- Guess That Number!.py
